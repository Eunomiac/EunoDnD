                    <hr>
                    <p><strong>Blind Fighting</strong></p>
                    <p>You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range,
                        you can effectively see anything that isn’t behind total cover,
                        even if you’re blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an
                        invisible creature within that range, unless the creature
                        successfully hides from you.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p><strong>Interception</strong></p>
                    <p>When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within
                        5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce
                        the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a
                        minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simple or
                        martial weapon to use this reaction.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p><strong>Superior Technique</strong></p>
                    <p>You can learn one maneuver of your choice from among those
                        available to the Battle Master archetype. If a maneuver you use
                        requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the
                        maneuver’s effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your
                        proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modidier (your
                        choice).</p>
                    <p>You gain one superiority die, which is a d6 (this die is added to
                        any superiority dice you have from another source). This die is
                        used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when
                        you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you
                        finish a short or long rest.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p><strong>Thrown Weapon Fighting</strong></p>
                    <p>You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the
                        attack you make with the weapon.</p>
                    <p>In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown
                        weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p><strong>Unarmed Fighting</strong></p>
                    <p>Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 +
                        your Strength modifier on a hit. If you aren’t wielding any
                        weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes
                        a d8.</p>
                    <p>At the start of each of your turns, you can deal
                        1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature
                        grappled by you.</p>

                            <p>A new page appears in your Book of Shadows. With your
                            permission, a creature can use its action to write its name on
                            that page, which
                            can contain a number of names equal to your proficiency bonus.</p>
                        <p>You can cast the sending spell, targeting a creature whose name
                            is on the page, without using a spell slot and without using
                            material components. To do so, you must write the message on the
                            page. The target hears the message in their mind, and if the
                            target replies, their message appears on the page, rather than
                            in your mind. The writing disappears after 1 minute.</p>
                        <p>As an
                            action, you can magically erase a name on the page by touching
                            it.</p>

                        points but not killed outright, the creature magically drops to 1
                        hit
                        point instead. Once this magic is triggered, no creature can
